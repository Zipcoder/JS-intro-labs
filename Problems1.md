For each of these problems, write a short program that will compute
and display the answer.

## Problem 1

The gas tank on our truck can hold 55.0 gallons of gas. 
When going long distances, the truck get 8.5 miles per gallon.

Q1: How far can our truck go without re-fueling?

It's a grain truck, so it's big and old and doesn't go very fast. 
If we travel at an average of 52 miles per hour,

Q2: How long will it take us to drive all those miles?

## Problem 2

Pets. You try to live with them, but they expect to eat everyday. 

Your Pekinese "Fluffy" eats twice a day, 1.6 _pounds(!)_ of dog chow at each meal.

Q1: How many days will a 50 lb bag of chow last?
Q2: How many days will 3 bags of 20 lbs last?

Finally, since "Fluffy" is obviously now a _small_ dog, if we could get a *ton* of
food delivered in a large bin, 

Q3: how long would that bin last?

A ton, you will recall, is 2200 pounds.

## Problem 3

If you bought a new sofa-lounge-mosh-pit for all your binge streaming from Lazy Ike's furniture store,
you know, the place down there next to that taco place you've been meaaning to try, for $2368. (tax included),

At 0% interest,

Q1: How many months would it take to pay it off at $200 a month?
Q2: How about at $350 a month?

## Problem 4

Your old pal Gerald saw some chairs and a table and a grill for sale in a yard somewhere. (He's not quite sure)

BUT he does remember that the chairs (4 of them) were $35 a piece, the table was $75 and the grill $22.

Q1: How much does the whole lot cost?
Q2: Would low-ball an offer to try to get it all?
Q3: Would you still offer if you new it was all rusty?

## Problem 5

Q1: Using a loop, sum the numbers from 1 to 10 and print the sum

Q2: Using a loop, sum the numbers from 13 to 41 and print the sum

Q3: Using a loop, sum the numbers from 100 to 10000 and print the sum

Q4: Using a loop, print the numbers from 51 to 38 (included) each on its own line
  make sure they go in reverse order.

Q5: Using a loop, print all the odd numbers from 1 to 30
Q6: Now print all the even numbers from 1 to 30
