For each of these problems, write a short program that will compute
and display the answer.

## Strings

## Problem 10

let states = [ "Arizona", "Alabama", "Colorado", "Arkansas", "Wisconsin", "Illinois", "Utah"];

Q1: Using a loop, Print out each string on its own line
Q2: Using a loop, print out the length of each state's name

// Using loops to find each of these

Q3: Print out the state with the shortest name
Q4: Print out the state with the longest name

Q6: Print out the states which DON'T start with "A"

## Problem 11

let text = "the last thing I saw was the monkey trying to put the cork back in"

Q1: split the text into an array of words (split the string on the spaces)
Q2: using that array, print the length of each word

Q3: create a new string with the words in reverse order

## Problem 12

let text = "how much wood can a woodchuck chuck if a woodchuck could chuck wood"

print out each string after transforming the original into a new string

Q1: build a new string with no "wood" or "chuck" in it
Q2: replace "wood" with "pasta"
Q3: replace "chuck" with "hound"

Q4: replace "wood" with "pasta" AND "chuck" with "hound"
