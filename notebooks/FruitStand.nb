// the Fruit Stand needs your help!

// here is today's order

let fruits = ["apple", "orange", "lime", "lemon", "pear", "peach", "apricot"];

let prices = [1.75, 1.0, 0.5, 0.75, 1.25, 1.50, 0.40]; // price of each piece of fruit

let qtyNeeded = [10, 12, 14, 18, 9, 8, 20];

// Q1: How many total pieces of fruit will there be?

// Q2: How much will the entire order cost?

// Q3: What is the most expensive category of fruit in this order?
// Q4: What is the cheapest category of fruit in this order?

// Q5: Which are most expensive, apples, pears or peaches?

// Q6: Print a table showing the details of the order
// Fruit, price, quantity, subtotal for this fruit
// and at the end show the total fruit order

// tabs maybe handy if you want to get fussy about formatting.
// also, how do you make sure your numbers always have just 2 decimal places $4.50 and not $4.5

// take care on each question using the loops.
