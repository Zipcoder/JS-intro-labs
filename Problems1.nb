### Problem 1

The gas tank on our truck can hold 55.0 gallons of gas. 
When going long distances, the truck gets 8.5 miles per gallon.

### Q1: How far can our truck go without re-fueling?

You need to set up two variables, and then multiple `tanksize` by `mpg`.

# %% [javascript]
let tanksize = 55;
let mpg = 8.5;

total_distance = tanksize * mpg;
console.log(total_distance.toFixed(2));

# %% [markdown]
It's a grain truck, so it's big and old and doesn't go very fast. 
If we travel at an average of 52 miles per hour,

### Q2: How long will it take us to drive all those miles?

You'll need to setup a `mph` variable and set it to 52.

What can you use from the previous solution?

# %% [javascript]
let tanksize = 55;
let mpg = 8.5;

total_distance = tanksize * mpg;

let mph = 52;

travel_time = total_distance / mph;
console.log(travel_time.toFixed(2));

### Problem 2

Pets. You try to live with them, but they expect to eat everyday. 

Your Pekinese "Fluffy" eats twice a day, 1.6 _pounds(!)_ of dog chow at each meal.

# %% [markdown]
### Q1: How many days will a 50 lb bag of chow last?
# %% [javascript]
// put your solution here.


# %% [markdown]
### Q2: How many days will 3 bags of 20 lbs last?
# %% [javascript]
// put your solution here.


Finally, since "Fluffy" is obviously now a _small_ dog, if we could get a *ton* of
food delivered in a large bin, 

# %% [markdown]
### Q3: how long would that bin last?

A ton, you will recall, is 2200 pounds.
